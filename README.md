### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used CSS Grid and Flexbox to position the elements on the blog card. This was a fun challenge and I feel like I'm starting to understand how to position and manipulate things on the screen better with each challenge.

### Continued development

I'm going to keep doing the challenges on Frontend Mentor, as well as some other challenge sites.
